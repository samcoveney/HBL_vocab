# Hambaanglaang Vocabulary 

Vocabulary sheets generated from [Hambaanglaang Storybooks Github](https://github.com/hblhk/stories) using a Python script.

The CSV files are organized by column as:
1. Chinese
2. Jyutping
3. English
4. Level
5. Frequency
 
The list of HambaangLaang stories are given in `HBL_story_list.csv`.

Each word appears only once in the master spreadsheet `HBL_vocab.csv`, and only one time in the level spreadsheets `HBL_vocab_X.csv`. Spreadsheet `HBL_vocab_2.csv` contains only level 2 words that are not in level 1. Spreadsheet `HBL_vocab_3.csv` contains only level 3 words that are not in level 1 or 2. And so on.

Additionally, some Anki decks are included for convenience.
